The **Focal Length** of a lens determines how far or close the ideal focus point of a lens is.

The **Aperture** indicates the amount of light being let through. A large aperture let's more light through, used for darker settings, whereas a small aperture limits the amount of light let through, better for brighter settings. Always use the lowest aperture setting that doesn't sacrifice image quality.

The **F-Stop** is calculated by dividing the focal length of a lens in millimeters by the aperture diameter in millimeters.  In our example:

$$
F Stop = \dfrac{Focal Length (mm)}{Aperture (mm)}
$$
$$
3.5 = \dfrac{55mm}{Aperture}
$$
$$
Aperture = \dfrac{55mm}{3.5} = 15.71mm
$$
