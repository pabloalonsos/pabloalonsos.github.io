I used to be sure of how high I wanted to aim in life. I would embrace change, 
and the uncertanty that would come with it. After almost ten years of pushing for the next big "thing",
I find myself not sure or not able to take the next step. I question myself if taking a "next step" is the right thing to do with my life.

I have a well-paying corporate job. I manage a small group of 10-15 engineers. I have potential for growth in the company. I'm able to pay all our bills. I can help my parents when they need my help. I can help my brothers to get through college. I'm able to save money and plan for our future (house, a kid or two, travel, etc). But, why do I feel  a totally acceptable life isn't enough? Why do I feel I'm wastig my life? Why do I feel unhappy?

"The right thing to do". 

I've always thought that the right thing to do is to give it all. Go for the 120%. This has been and is a double-edged sword of course. It makes me live in the future and never be contempt.  When I was 20 I decided to leave everything behind, pack a suitcase, and move to the U.S with money for two years of school. I owe everything to my parents who went above and beyond to give me those two years. I graduated, I found a job while in school consulting with a small firm, and, by caring about what I do I ended up with the gig I have now.

What am I missing?

An idea I am passionate about. An idea to which I can give everything to.
