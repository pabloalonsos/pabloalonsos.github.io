Hello reader. I'm not sure what brought you here nor if you will find what you are looking for.

Now that the expectations have been set at a fair level, here is a **TL;DR** of myself:

* My name is **Pablo Alonso Subinas**.
* I'm originally from :house: **Bilbao** in the north of Spain.
* I came to the US to finish my studies in **Computer Engineering** in 2012
* I got an internship in 2013 at HBO which led me to meet and join a small group of consultants (Neosavvy) which led me to eventually join Bloomberg as a full time employee. Now employed there as a **Senior Engineering Manager**.
* I also met a girl back in 2012, who I'm now **married** to, and we have a Great Pyrenees named **Pepper** :dog:!


Lately I've felt that I've been all over the place, doing a lot but feeling like accomplishing very little. So I'm looking to add some structure to what I want to focus on, for how long and being clear on what I want to achieve with it.


## Where should I start?

How do I want to use my time? What do I want to focus on?

There are time-bound streams and non-time-bound streams of things I want/need to focus on.

Non time-boumd
* 9-5 Job that brings money in. For now, I have no choice but to have one.
* Studying Chess
* Training BJJ
* Read
* Write a blog


## Habits

* Train BJJ 4 times a week (~6 hours)
* Study chess every weekend
* Read every day
* Work on side business for 2 hours every day
