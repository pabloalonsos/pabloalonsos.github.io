The process I'll attempt to follow while I write this text is to ask the Five Whys to the things I list with the hope I'll reach to some common ideas that I unconciously rely one to decide what to do.

### A Perfect Life

How do I would picture a perfect life? what are its traits? what's the relative importance of what it composes it?

The idea of this is to define something specific, assess its different items' relative importance and craft course of action to get there.

Some rough ideas before I add some structure to this:

- I would not like to be bound to an employer. Working for myself (or not working at all) would be my preferred setup so that I can explore life without boundaries.
- I would like to be able to learn new traits in a way that I have the necessary resources to do it, effectively, in depth and with the time needed to enjoy it.
- I would like to live next to the water, where food is good and where I'm able to spend time with friends and family, but while still having the ability to get the most out of every opportunity life has to offer.
- I would like to make sure that my family is taking care of. Both my direct family (wife? children?) as well as my brothers and parents (specially my parents).

How to not be bound by an employer:
- start my own company/startup
- rise up the ranks of a corporation to the top
- build something that takes off enough to pay the bills. rinse and repeat.
- save enough money to be able to be self-sustained for the rest of my life

Where do I live (location):
- house in bilbao (laukariz?) : 600,000 * 2/3 = 400,000
- house in kilby pt (alex's parents?): 750,000 * 2/3 = 500,000
- apartment in NYC (): duplex? - $~2M
- Total: $ ~3M
- For other places, go with hotels.

How do I use my time?
- Have a routine:
  - "work": 9 to 5 but on something i want instead of for a company
  - train BJJ: once a day 1.5 to 2 hours
  - study: dive deep on topic non "work" related
  - read:
  - relax:

### Behaviors and Decisions to Make/Change

What do I need to make it happen?


- Finish Argon v1
  - Deploy Dev environment
  - Deploy Prod environment
  - Connect to Amazon API
  - Scrape kit.com to populate
  - Open beta to friends

- Build "aquisition timeline app"
- Build generic timeline app (company acquisitions, onboarding processes, any)
